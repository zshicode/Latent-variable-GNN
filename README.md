# Differential equation and probability inspired graph neural networks for latent variable learning

This repository consists some models w.r.t. differential equation and probability inspired graph neural networks for latent variable learning.

Contents

- `gcn-lp-filter`  consists some models for node classification.
- `graph-classifier-dgl`  consists some models for graph pooling and classification, using some examples of [DGL](https://docs.dgl.ai/).
- `graph-classifier-vi`  consists some models combining variational inference models (e.g. VGAE, Planar flow, Normalizing flow, Inverse autoregressive flow, etc.) to graph neural networks for graph pooling and classification, based on [Graph U-Nets](https://github.com/HongyangGao/Graph-U-Nets) .
