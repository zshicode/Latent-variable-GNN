# Differential equation and probability inspired graph neural networks for latent variable learning

This repository consists some models with respect to [Differential equation and probability inspired graph neural networks for latent variable learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13800).

## Contents

- `gcn-lp-filter`  consists some models for node classification.
- `graph-classifier-dgl`  consists some models for graph pooling and classification, using some examples of [DGL](https://docs.dgl.ai/).
- `graph-classifier-vi`  consists some models combining variational inference models (e.g. VGAE, Planar flow, Normalizing flow, Inverse autoregressive flow, etc.) to graph neural networks for graph pooling and classification, based on [Graph U-Nets](https://github.com/HongyangGao/Graph-U-Nets) .
